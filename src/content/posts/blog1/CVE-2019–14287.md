### A tutorial room exploring CVE-2019-14287 in the Unix Sudo Program. Room One in the SudoVulns Series

**Task 1: Deploy**
==================

```
ssh -p <port-number> <username>@<remote-machine-ip>
```

**Task 2: Security Bypass**
===========================

First question arise in our mind how we can find and exploit it ? So first we have to check that if our machine is vulnerable or not

If the result comes the same as above `ALL=(ALL,!root) /bin/bash`, So there might be 50% chance that the security bypass work to make it 100% sure that It will bypass security you have to run another command

![Check Version of machine](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*tljqQqVfF7IUSVvIk_FJFA.png)

So if your machine version is `Version : Sudo <1.8.28` , it will work

**Note** `**: The bug is fixed in sudo 1.8.28**`

Now we already knew its vulnerable and, we have also check but in case you are playing any CTF or giving any exam you have to knew how does it’s working, So now comes to my favorite part which is Security Bypassing

**Root Flag !!!**
=================

**Challenges:**
===============

**#1. What command are you allowed to run with sudo?**
**Ans**: /bin/bash

**#2. What is the flag in /root/root.txt?**
**Ans**: THM{l33t_********_******}

We are done! Great job everyone.
